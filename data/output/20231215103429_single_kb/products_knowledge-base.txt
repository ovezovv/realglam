Name: Basis NAD+ Supplement for Cellular Aging
Description: 'Basis by Elysium Health is a dietary supplement designed to revolutionize the approach to cellular aging. Central to its formulation is the enhancement of Nicotinamide Adenine Dinucleotide (NAD+), a vital coenzyme in every cell of the body.

This increase in NAD+ supports critical cellular functions and aids in rejuvenating cells from the inside, contributing to improved vitality and health. Additionally, Basis includes Pterostilbene, a powerful antioxidant that complements the action of Nicotinamide Riboside, further enhancing the supplement's effectiveness in fighting the signs of aging at the cellular level.

Regular use of Basis is said to result in numerous health benefits, including improved energy levels, enhanced cellular repair and maintenance, and better overall metabolic health. These benefits contribute to a feeling of rejuvenation and vitality, particularly for those experiencing age-related decline in energy and health.
